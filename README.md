I recently bought a model rocket kit from [apogee rockets](https://www.apogeerockets.com/Rocket_Kits/Skill_Level_1_Kits/Apprentice_Starter_Set).

My whole family has also been watching a lot of [Space X](https://twitter.com/SpaceX) launches (and landings!) and the entire family is very excited about space and rockets.

At this point I have compiled some checklists needed for launch day based partially on spacex's webcast of their launch and partially based on the instructions of our rocket kit (see link above).

In the future I am going to build a website and eventually an iPad app for launch day checklists and countdowns.

Features:
* countdown clock
* checklists
  * standard built in checklists
  * ability to modify checklists
* weather report
* compass showing wind direction (based on weather api)
* flight status (pre-flight prep, abort, hold, flight, recovery)
* checklist status tied in to countdown (see below)
* in the future I would like to modify our launch pad controller to be able to launch the rocket via bluetooth from the iPad


Since this is model rocketry and we are not actually sending anything to space the countdown timer is not really necessary (but it is fun). Real rockets need to launch within a certain window so it can hit its targeted orbit and if it needs to rendezvous with another vehicle (like the ISS) it needs to launch within the correct window. Model rockets do not have this constraint. However, I would like to keep the countdown timer without the hassel of having to wait to launch once everything is ready.
Due to this I will make the timer hold if a certain checklist is not completed by a certain time and skip ahead if the checklists are checked off ahead of schedule. This will allow the kids to complete the checklists in whatever amount of time they need without having to wait for long times to get to the best part; the launch!

stay tuned for update.
